As a recent Cybersecurity graduate with a good fundamental knowledge of IT systems and technical support, I am eager to apply the academic knowledge I developed throughout my education in a professional setting. The academic work I've completed during my courses have provided me with essential experience in understanding and managing computer systems.

Despite struggles I've experienced as an autistic individual, I remain ambitious, driven and willing to work hard towards achieving my aim of successfully making a career for myself in IT, excited to apply my capabilities in the workplace so that I can contribute to your organisation's goals while continuously expanding my skillset. My passion and ambition to work with technology for a living has driven me to orchastrate my own personal projects used for the purpose of illustrating my ability and willingness to learn and excel towards my first entry level job in the field of cyber.

Projects I've partaken in have given me fundamental insights into some of the most advanced areas in IT, such as learning how to uncover system vulnerabilities and utilise various software tools to gather intel and exploit a system's weaknesses. I've also developed strong skills in other areas such as programming and data analytics, and have become proficient at being able to work both independently and collaboratively.

The intention of this web-portfolio is to give a more in-depth insight into the range of skills I've gained throughout my time in education as well as to highlight what abilties I've developed since having left my university course. I hope you enjoy learning more about me and what I have to offer through this personal portfolio.

*Thanks for Reading!*
